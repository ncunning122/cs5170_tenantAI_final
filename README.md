# Tenant.AI 

This repository contains the code to create a webapp that contains a chatbot capable of answering queries about tenants rights of residents in Massachusetts.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `Web_Interface/`: Contains the React project that creates the user interface that contains resouces that might be useful for a resident as well as a chatbot interface.
- `tenant-ai-chatbot/`: Contains the React project that creates a RAG powered chatbot capable of answering quering about tenants rights.


Currently, the RAG-based chatbot has not been integrated into the main webapp and is hence presented as two projects.

## Screenshots for the interface created are [here](Screenshots/)
