# TenantAI web UI
2024-11-18

This project serves as a functional representation of the web interface for the TenantAI tool.

The landing page contains a short description of the tool, references to external resources, and an AI-powered chatbot interface.

The AI-powered chatbot is a placeholder--the fully-functional chatbot is located in a separate project, and the two projects will be combined for the final project submission.

Login functionality will be implemented prior to the final submission as well.


To interact with the web interface, open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run "npm install" followed by "npm start".
